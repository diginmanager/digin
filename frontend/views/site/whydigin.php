				<p class="txtaln">In this world everyone wants his/her WANTS to be fulfilled. Everyone wants that, that he/she doesn’t have or possess. For that we keep on the search to find where we can fetch our WANTS till we find them. Most of the times the WANTS we want are hidden or concealed beneath or within somethings; so we need to dig in so that to reach and discover our WANTS. So the process of searching is in real sense digging.</p>
				<p class="txtaln">The nature of the Earth is such that to avail most of the things we need to dig inside; there is no other alternative, in fact there can’t be any. To achieve a good catch fishermen need to dig inside the oceans. To get coal and other mining products the miners have to dig inside the Earth’s crust. The students dig inside their school-bags for the books, they dig inside the books for knowledge, they dig inside the mind for understanding and they dig inside the consciousness for realization. In other words learning is also in a way digging inside. Plants dig inside with the help of their roots to get the nutrients. Archeologists dig inside to explore the origins. So, not just ‘digging’ but ‘digging inside’ is about exploring and discovering. And you also need to explore the markets deep inside before selling or buying anything. Simply put, for anything and everything you need to digin.</p>
				<p class="txtaln">We can describe evolution of civilization into three stages. The first one was localization. At this stage civilizations were decentralized but unconnected.</p>
				<p class="txtaln">Then with technological advances connectivity gradually grew and grew and eventually reached the whole world which is the second stage of evolution known as globalization.</p>
				<p class="txtaln">But with this connectivity, globalization brought about centralization. Centralization and decentralization both have their pros and cons. With no option of decentralization in globalization, civilization got affected from the pros of decentralization. Now is the third stage of evolution where centralized and decentralized connectivity can co-exist which is called glocalization.</p>
				<p class="txtaln">Business to business (B2B) refers to a situation where one business makes a commercial transaction with another business entity. Business to consumer (B2C) is business or transactions conducted directly between a company and consumers who are the end-users of its products or services. In the real world the e-middlemen are driving B2B and B2C transactions. There are many instances where the Business entities and consumers are at the mercy of the e-middlemen and are never allowed to meet directly. These eventually affect the commercial transactions.</p>
				<p class="txtaln">Online portals are the digital counterpart of age-old platforms for different purposes. e-commerce portals similar to conventional commercial establishments are designed and created for one central purpose of doing commerce. Hence usage of portals primarily designed and created for sharing information, chatting and gossiping, for increasing trade is not that effective as a purely focused e-commerce portal.</p>
				<p class="txtaln">digin comply with the DIPP’s guidelines for e-commerce marketplace.</p>
				<p class="txtaln">Any organization’s website is just a digital version of its workplace. To sell a product or a service it is imperative to take it to the market because market is the only place where business entities and consumers gather and interact on their own generating multiple options for trade to happen. Individual website lack this concept of multiplicity and hence many organizations cease to maintain their websites with regular updates</p>
				<p class="txtaln">With the above contexts a very strong and innovative tool to enhance worldwide trade was need of the time and digin is that tool.</p>
